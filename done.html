        <h2>The Truth Behind My First Million</h2>

        <p>Whoever thinks "performance" is a marketing metric doesn’t know a shit about marketing.</p>

        <p>If you still think marketing is the science of choosing between CBOs and ABOs, or if you’re still jerking off on "Andromeda" thinking you’ve cracked the code, do us both a favor: close this page. Go back to your dashboards. This isn't for you.</p>
        
        <p>An e-commerce I manage just broke its first million dollars. By modern standards, I should be celebrating. But I’m not. I’m pissed off. To get this client to this million, I had to do everything except the part of the job I actually love. I spent the last year acting as a glorified logistics manager and a slave to pixel data, obsessed with technicalities that have zero soul. That isn't marketing. That’s digital plumbing.</p>
        
        <p>I hate this "performance" era because it’s a distraction from the work itself, built on the assumption that the only goal is maximum profit, maximum speed. I look at the industry now and it feels like a casino. Everyone treats this job like a fucking video game. Budget up, budget down. Turn the knob left, turn the knob right. It’s like playing with money without any sense of value or direction. They think "scaling" is just pressing a button, completely ignoring that there are actual human beings on the other side of the screen.</p>
        
        <p>I learned the opposite. My first boss, Furio, was one of the greatest men I’ve ever met. He didn't care about the buttons; he cared about the message. He had this incredible capacity to spend 15 years learning how to think, how to understand the market, just so he could spend five minutes writing a campaign that would change everything. That is mastery. That is respect for the craft. Not for the money.</p>
        
        <p>And then I look at Carlo. The man understands branding in his bones. We manage a 35-year-old beauty brand with a deep, sustainable mission. And you know what? It grows slowly. And we don’t give a fuck about the speed. Because we are protecting a legacy. We look at the big picture, the reason the company exists, while everyone else is staring at their daily return on ad spend. I have never cared about money in this job, and I probably never will. I only care about doing something well, because I love the *doing*—not because I can capitalize on it.</p>
        
        <p>This extreme capitalization of everything is exactly why I shot down "Beyond Digital," my landing page service. It was profitable, sure. But I couldn't stomach it anymore. Everything now is a copycat. Nobody gives a shit about true marketing or branding. Every request was "make it look like them" or "copy this template." I refused to participate in this race to the bottom, this digital factory line.</p>
        
        <p>I recently read a post on Reddit: some 15-year-old guy asking how to "blast" the AI-generated e-commerce he created so he could help his girlfriend. What the fuck? A 15-year-old thinking about maximizing revenue instead of enjoying his childhood? We’re fucked. We have traded passion for profit and youth for hustling, and the entire industry is rotting.</p>
        
        <p>So, here is the uncomfortable truth about this first million: It feels empty because the industry has lost its way. If you think marketing is a game of budget allocation, you are fragile. Real marketing is about building something that survives when the algorithm changes, driven by passion for the product and the message, not the maximization of capital.</p>
        
        <p>I am done playing the performance game. If you're looking for someone to push numbers, go hire a kid with a calculator. But I'm going back to the roots. Back to the thinking. Back to the big picture.</p>
